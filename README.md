FULL-Stack Test

Notes:
 - Had a lot of fun with this one, it looked like a lot of effort went into to make it mirror day to day stuff at Dgauge, really appreciate that!
 - Was adding and committing as I went but was inside the backend repo and pushed the frontend and backend from the root. Apologies for that.
 - The flow of commits went: fetch data needed -> manipulate data to get to the ideal structure -> some minor refactoring and cleaning up.
 - The code is still quite raw and ugly, I just have not had the time to get it exactly how I want it, hoping to have it cleaner in the next couple ways.
 - Was consious the whole time of testing, the Cypress tests were really helpful to get insights into the final results, had used that as the structure I wanted to transform the data into
